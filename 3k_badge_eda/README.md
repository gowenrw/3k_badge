# 3k_badge_eda

Electronic Design Automation files for the badge PCB (EDA is KiCad)

* 3000_Society_Badge_K5 - KiCad 5.x project folder for the 3000 Society Conference version of the badge
* DC27_3000_Society_Badge_K5 - KiCad 5.x project folder for the Defcon 27 Conference version of the badge

Shitty Addon (SAO) KiCad files downloaded from here:

I ended up not doing the SAO connector as planned due to time constraints.
