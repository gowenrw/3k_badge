# graphics

Artwork and other graphics created by this project for the badge

I used Adobe Illustrator to create the vector graphics that are to be exported to KiCad.

I have included the special fonts I used in these graphics files in case they are needed to properly edit them.
These fonts are in a fonts subdirectory here.
