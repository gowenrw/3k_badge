[HOME](/) - [DETAILS](3kbadge_details.md) - [PARTS](3kbadge_components.md) - [ASSEMBLY](3kbadge_assembly.md) - [CODE](3kbadge_code.md) - [I_WANT_ONE!](3kbadge_i_want_one.md)

The original version of the badge was designed for and distributed at the 3000 society conference May 31st - June 1st 2019.
Conference attendees were provided this badge at no extra change.
This was a small conference and thus there was only a small number of these badges made.
The few extras that exist will be available at the Defcon 27 conference along with the new version.

A new version of the badge was designed for the Defcon 27 conference August 8-11 2019.
These badges will be available for purchase at the conference at a location yet to be determined.

Here are the badge options that will be available at Defcon 27:

Note: `The badge kits will NOT contain a Battery.`
We determined it would be too much hassle to try to get over 100 batteries to Vegas.
We will have a few with us available for sale at $20 per battery.
Any micro USB battery bank will work to power the badge (the same type used to charge cell phones).
If you are planning on buying a kit consider purchasing a slim credit card size USB battery ahead of time to take with you.
They are available on Amazon and elsewhere for $15 or less.
See the [PARTS](3kbadge_components.md) page for battery details and purchase links.
