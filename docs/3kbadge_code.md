# Godzilla vs. Blade Runner Badge Code

[HOME](/) [DETAILS](3kbadge_details.md) [PARTS](3kbadge_components.md) [ASSEMBLY](3kbadge_assembly.md) [CODE](3kbadge_code.md)

This is where you will find detailed step by step instructions on how to update the firmware and add or change code on the trinket m0 that controls the badge.

I just have to finish writing them first.
