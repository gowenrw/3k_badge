This is where you will find detailed step by step instructions on how to assemble the badge.

## Assembly steps

<ol>

<li> Solder the Trinket M0 header pins
<ul>
<li> The Trinket comes with a single breakable 1x16pin header strip.  Break off two 5 pin sections to use. </li>
<li> <img src="Trinket_01.JPG"> </li>
<li> Save the left over 6 pin male header to use later </li>
<li> Place the two five pin header strips into the Trinket PCB inserting the short end into the through holes. </li>
<li> Solder these header pins on the top of the Trinket PCB </li>

<li> <img src="Trinket_03.JPG"> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> Solder the resistors to the Badge
<ul>
<li> Place the eight resistors into the badge PCB through holes with the components on the front of the PCB. </li>
<li> <img src="Resistors_01.JPG"> </li>
<li> Bending the resistor legs slightly will hold them in place. </li>
<li> The direction the resistor is placed does not matter. </li>
<li> <img src="Resistors_02.JPG"> </li>
<li> Be sure that the 100ohm resistor is in the R3 position mark on the back of the PCB. </li>
<li> Solder the resistors on the back of the PCB. </li>
<li> Cut off the resistor pins close to the back of the PCB (not too close or it will damage your solder joints) </li>
<li> <img src="Resistors_03.JPG"> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> Solder the capacitors to the Badge
<ul>
<li> Place the five capacitors into the badge PCB through holes with the components on the front of the PCB. </li>
<li> <img src="Capacitors_01.JPG"> </li>
<li> Bending the capacitor legs slightly will hold them in place. </li>
<li> The direction the capacitors are placed is IMPORTANT. </li>
<li> The long leg is positive and the short leg where the 0 is printed on the cap is negative. </li>
<li> The long positive legs should be nearer to the outside edge of the PCB. </li>
<li> <img src="Capacitors_02.JPG"> </li>
<li> Solder the capacitors on the back of the PCB. </li>
<li> Cut off the capacitor pins close to the back of the PCB (not too close or it will damage your solder joints) </li>
<li> <img src="Capacitors_03.JPG"> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> Solder the female headers to the Badge
<ul>
<li> Place the two 5 pin header strips male pins into the badge PCB through holes with the female headers on the front of the PCB. </li>
<li> Use the left over 6 pin male header from the Trinket to keep these headers at 90 degrees from the PCB. </li>
<li> The 6 pin male header is the perfect size to represent the trinket for spacing, just plug into the middle of each female header </li>
<li> <img src="Headers_01.JPG"> </li>
<li> Place the board down on the headers or use a bit of tape on the front to hold them in place. </li>
<li> <img src="Headers_02.JPG"> </li>
<li> * Solder the headers on the back of the PCB. </li>
<li> <img src="Headers_03.JPG"> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> Solder the NeoPixel LEDs to the Badge
<ul>
<li> Place the ten NeoPixel LEDs into the badge PCB through holes with the components on the front of the PCB. </li>
<li> <img src="LEDs_01.JPG"> </li>
<li> With four legs they should stay in place by friction alone. However, you can bend the LED legs slightly if needed. </li>
<li> The direction the NeoPixel LEDs are placed is IMPORTANT.  </li>
<li> On the 5mm LEDs the long leg should go in the through hole that is a rectangle instead of an oval. </li>
<li> The long leg is on the side of the LED that has a flat notch.  The back of the PCB shows where this notch should be aligned. </li>
<li> <img src="LEDs_04.JPG"> </li>
<li> On the 8mm LEDs the long leg should go in through hole that is the oval pad next to the rectangle one. </li>
<li> On these bigger LEDs the long leg is pin 2 not pin 1 like the smaller LEDs </li>
<li> The long leg is on the side of the LED that has a flat notch.  The back of the PCB shows where this notch should be aligned. </li>
<li> <img src="LEDs_02.JPG"> </li>
<li> I would suggest placing and then soldering only a few LEDs at a time because they are very close together. </li>
<li> Solder the NeoPixel LEDs on the back of the PCB. </li>
<li> Cut off the LED pins close to the back of the PCB (not too close or it will damage your solder joints) </li>
<li> <img src="LEDs_03.JPG"> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> Insert the Trinket m0 onto the badge
<ul>
<li> Place the Trinket m0 male pins into the female headers on the front of the board </li>
<li> Be sure to align the Trinket with its USB connector towards the edge of the PCB </li>
<li> Each Trinket has been preloaded with the code to control the badge.  See the code link above for details. </li>
<li> <img src="Trinket_04.JPG"> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> Attach the Battery to the badge
<ul>
<li> Apply the Velcro strip to the badge PCB (Use the soft Velcro here in case you wear the badge without the battery) </li>
<li> Apply the Velcro strip to the Battery </li>
<li> <img src="Battery_01.JPG"> </li>
<li> Feed the Battery cable through the rectangle hole in the PCB </li>
<li> <img src="Battery_02.JPG"> </li>
<li> Connect the Battery cable to the Trinket </li>
<li> Do this before you attach the Battery to the badge to avoid having to make readjustments </li>
<li> <img src="Battery_03.JPG"> </li>
<li> Attach the Battery to the back of the badge by sticking the Velcro strips together </li>
<li> <img src="Battery_04.JPG"> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> Attach the Lanyard to the badge
<ul>
<li> The Lanyard J Clip should clip into the hole at the top center of the badge PCB </li>
<li> <img src="Lanyard_01.JPG"> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> Rock the badge at the CON!
<ul>
<li> Touching the Tyrel building will change LED modes. </li>
<li> One of the LED modes is all off in case you need to quickly turn off without removing the battery. </li>
